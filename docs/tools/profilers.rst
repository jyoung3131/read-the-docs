Profilers
============

Profiling code is an important part of the optimization process for running new applications on novel architectures. While profilers typically target more mature architectures, there are a wide variety of Linux-based tools that can be used to evaluate the performance of your code, find bottlenecks, and optimize the execution of your code.
